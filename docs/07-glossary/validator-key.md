# Validator Key

**Definition:** A validator key is essential for participants who want to become validators. It consists of a public key, used to identify the validator within the network, and a private key, used to sign blocks and attestations. The validator key must be securely managed, as exposure can lead to slashing, where the validator's staked ETH is penalized for malicious or contradictory actions.

**Category:** Staking

**Example:** A validator's private key signs attestations and block proposals, verifying their participation and agreement with the blockchain state. If compromised, it could lead to malicious actions, like double signing, which results in slashing.
