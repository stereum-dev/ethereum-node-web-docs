# Attestation Rewards

**Definition:** Attestation Rewards are earned by validators for successfully attesting to the validity of a block. Validators vote on the correctness of blocks, and these attestations contribute to the consensus process, helping to secure the network and ensure the integrity of the blockchain.

**Category:** Staking

**Example:** Validators earn attestation rewards by participating in the consensus process, where they check and confirm the validity of blocks proposed by other validators. Their reward is proportional to the timeliness and accuracy of their attestations.
