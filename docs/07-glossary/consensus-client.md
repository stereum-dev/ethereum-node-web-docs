# Consensus Client

**Definition:** A Consensus Client is responsible for the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, managing the state of the blockchain, validating transactions, and proposing new blocks. It works alongside the [Execution Client](#execution-client) to maintain the blockchain's integrity and security.

**Category:** Node

**Example:** Lighthouse and Prysm are examples of Consensus Clients that validators use to participate in the consensus process, propose blocks, and validate transactions.
