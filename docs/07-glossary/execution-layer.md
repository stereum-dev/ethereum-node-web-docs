# Execution Layer

**Definition:** The Execution Layer is responsible for executing transactional logic and maintaining the network's state. It includes processing transactions, executing smart contracts, and managing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This layer works in tandem with the Consensus Layer to ensure the correct execution of blockchain operations.

**Category:** Blockchain Network

**Example:** When a transaction is submitted, the Execution Layer verifies its validity, executes the transaction, and updates the network's state accordingly.
