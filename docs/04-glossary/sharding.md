# Sharding

**Definition:** Sharding is a scalability strategy used in blockchain technology to enhance the processing capacity of a network. It involves dividing the network's database into smaller, more manageable pieces, or "shards," each of which can process transactions and store data independently. This parallel processing capability significantly increases the network's throughput and efficiency. 

**Category:** Blockchain Network

**Example:** In Ethereum, sharding will create 64 new shard chains that operate alongside the main blockchain, greatly increasing the system's capacity for processing transactions and storing data. This means that instead of having every node process every transaction, subsets of nodes will process transactions specific to their shard, enhancing the network's overall performance and scalability.
