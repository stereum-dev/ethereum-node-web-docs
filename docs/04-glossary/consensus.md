# Consensus

**Definition:** Consensus in blockchain technology is the process used to achieve agreement on a single state of the network among distributed nodes. In Ethereum, the consensus mechanism ensures that transactions and blocks are valid and agreed upon by all participating nodes, thereby maintaining the blockchain's integrity and continuity.

**Category:** Blockchain Network

**Example:** Ethereum's transition to the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism allows validators, chosen through staking, to agree on the order and validity of transactions in the blockchain.
