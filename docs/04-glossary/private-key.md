# Private Key

**Definition:** A private key in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency is a secret alphanumeric code that proves the ownership of a blockchain address and allows access to the assets stored in that address. It is used to sign transactions, ensuring the security and integrity of the assets and confirming the identity of the holder. The private key must be kept confidential and not shared with anyone to prevent unauthorized access to the assets.
