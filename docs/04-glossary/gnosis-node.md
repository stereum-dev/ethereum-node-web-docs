# Gnosis Node

**Definition:** A Gnosis node is a computer running the Gnosis client software, participating in the Gnosis Chain, which utilizes the same core architecture as Ethereum. It is part of a decentralized peer-to-peer network, validating transactions and blocks, and maintaining the integrity of the Gnosis blockchain. Gnosis nodes operate under a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, allowing for active participation in block proposals and attestations.

**Category:** Node

**Example:** By running a Gnosis node, individuals can engage directly with the Gnosis Chain, supporting network operations and potentially earning rewards for validating transactions and blocks.
