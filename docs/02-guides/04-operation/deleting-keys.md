# Remove Validator Keys

## Procedure for Secure Key Deletion

1. **Delete Keys on Node**: Initiate the deletion process directly on your node.
2. **Wait and Monitor**: After deletion, wait for two epochs to ensure the keys are completely inactive.
3. **Verification**: Use a trusted third-party source like beaconcha.in to confirm that there is full inactivity and no unexpected behavior.
