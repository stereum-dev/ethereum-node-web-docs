### Migrate Validator Keys

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Validator Key Migration

1. **Remove Keys**: Utilize the Stereum Staking tab to safely remove your keys.
2. **Save Slashing Database**: Ensure you back up your slashing database to prevent any future penalties.
3. **Delete Virtual Machine**: It is crucial to remove the entire virtual machine, including all associated disks, not just the Stereum application. This ensures that all elements are completely eradicated.
