### Validator Key Deposit

**Definition:** A key deposit in the context of Ethereum & Gnosis staking refers to the initial amount of ETH / GNO required to activate a validator on the respective blockchain. This deposit is made to the staking deposit contract and is associated with the validator's public key, enabling the network to recognize and activate the validator. The deposit serves as a stake in the network, signifying the validator's commitment and serving as collateral that can be slashed in case of malicious actions.

**Category:** Staking

**Example:** To become a validator on the Ethereum network, one must submit a key deposit of 32 ETH to the staking deposit contract. This deposit, along with the associated validator keys, activates the validator's participation in the network consensus.
