### Activation Queue
**Definition:** The Activation Queue is a waiting period for validators before they become active and participate in network consensus. This queue is necessary to manage the influx of new validators and maintain network stability, governed by the churn limit which dictates the number of validators activated in each epoch.

**Category:** Staking

**Example:** Once a validator submits their 32 ETH deposit, they enter the activation queue. The duration in this queue is influenced by the churn limit and existing queue length. During periods of high demand, this can lead to extended waiting times before a validator becomes active.
