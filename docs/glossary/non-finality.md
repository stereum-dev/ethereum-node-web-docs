### Non-Finality

**Definition:** Non-Finality in blockchain refers to the state where transactions or blocks are not yet confirmed as irreversible and permanent. In blockchain systems, finality means that once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered or removed. Non-Finality occurs in situations where there is uncertainty about a block's permanence, potentially due to network forks, consensus failures, or other disruptions. This state can lead to risks such as double-spending, where the same digital asset could be spent more than once.

**Example:** In blockchain networks where consensus is reached gradually, like in Proof of Work (PoW) systems, there is a period of non-finality after a block is mined but before it is deeply embedded in the chain. During this time, the block could still be part of a temporary fork that might get discarded if another chain becomes longer, leading to the block's reversal.
