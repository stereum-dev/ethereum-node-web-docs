### Sync Committee
**Definition:** A Sync Committee is a group of validators in the Ethereum network that is responsible for helping light clients (such as mobile wallets or lightweight nodes) stay synchronized with the state of the chain. The committee produces signatures that light clients use to verify the chain's state without needing to process every block, thus enabling more efficient and reliable synchronization. For this duty the selected group of validators will earn additional rewards in the form of [Sync Committee Rewards](#sync-committee-rewards)

**Category:** Staking

**Example:** In the Ethereum network, a Sync Committee is selected periodically (e.g., every 256 epochs) and consists of a fixed number of validators. These validators sign a snapshot of the chain state, which light clients can then use to quickly and securely update their view of the blockchain without processing each block in detail.
