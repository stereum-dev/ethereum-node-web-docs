### SSV (Secret Shared Validator)

**Definition:** Secret Shared Validator (SSV) refers to a type of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) that enables the splitting of a validator key among multiple nodes, known as operators. This setup allows for the distributed control and operation of an Ethereum validator across multiple non-trusting nodes, enhancing security and fault tolerance.

**Category:** Staking

**Example:** In an SSV setup, if an Ethereum staking participant wants to enhance the security and uptime of their validator, they can distribute the operation of their validator key among four different nodes. Even if one or two of these nodes go offline or act maliciously, the others can continue to perform the necessary consensus duties, thus reducing the risk of slashing and downtime.
