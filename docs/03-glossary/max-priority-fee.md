# Max Priority Fee

**Definition:** The Max Priority Fee is the maximum amount a user is willing to pay as a priority fee (tip) to miners or validators. It represents the user's willingness to pay extra to expedite their transaction. When the transaction is included in a block, any difference between the max priority fee and the actual priority fee is refunded to the user.

**Example:** In a high-demand period, setting a higher max priority fee can increase the chances of a transaction being included in the next block. If the actual priority fee ends up being lower, the user will receive a refund of the difference.
