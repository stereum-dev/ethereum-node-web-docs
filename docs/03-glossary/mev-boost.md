# MEV Boost

**Definition:** MEV Boost is a protocol that allows validators to connect with external MEV-relay networks to enhance their MEV opportunities. It acts as a middleware between validators and block builders, enabling validators to produce blocks with higher MEV rewards without directly participating in MEV strategies.

**Category:** Blockchain

**Example:** With MEV Boost, a validator can receive blocks from an external builder that has optimized the transaction ordering for maximum MEV extraction, thereby increasing the profitability of block production.
