# Attestation

**Definition:** Attestation is the process by which validators verify and vouch for the correctness of a block. Every epoch, validators propose attestations that represent their view of the blockchain state, including the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch. Attestations are critical for the network to reach consensus and finalize blocks.

**Category:** Staking

**Example:** A validator, upon being chosen, will create an attestation for a specific slot within an epoch. This attestation includes their assertion of the current state of the blockchain, contributing to the network's consensus process. If the attestation aligns with the majority of validators' views, it aids in finalizing blocks and maintaining the network's integrity.
