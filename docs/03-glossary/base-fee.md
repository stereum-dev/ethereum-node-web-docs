### Base Fee
**Definition:** The base fee is the minimum price per unit of [gas](#gas) for a transaction to be included in the blockchain. It fluctuates depending on network demand, ensuring the blockchain remains at target capacity.

**Category:** Blockchain

**Example:** If the network is congested, the base fee increases to prioritize transactions and reduce demand, whereas in times of lower activity, the base fee decreases.
