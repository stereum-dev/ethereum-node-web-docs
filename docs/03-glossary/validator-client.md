# Validator Client

**Definition:** A Validator Client refers to software that enables a node to participate in the network's consensus mechanism by proposing and attesting to blocks. Validators are crucial for the security and functionality of the blockchain, as they are responsible for signing verified transactions and newly created blocks in exchange for staking rewards.

**Category:** Node

**Example:** In Ethereum, an individual can run a validator client importing a validator key by depositing 32 ETH, which allows them to actively participate in block proposal and attestation processes. The validator client software manages the process of signing blocks, maintaining the blockchain's state, and communicating with other nodes in the network.
