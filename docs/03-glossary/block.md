# Block

**Definition:** A block in blockchain technology is a data structure that aggregates a set of transactions, along with additional information, into a single, cryptographically secured unit. Each block contains a reference (hash) to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks, hence the term "blockchain." Blocks are created through a consensus process among network participants (like miners in Proof of Work or validators in Proof of Stake systems) and once validated and added to the blockchain, they become an immutable part of the ledger history.

**Category:** Blockchain Network

**Example:** In Ethereum, the time to create a new block containing a list of all recent transactions is 12 seconds, for Gnosis it is 6 seconds. Each block includes a hash of the previous block, creating a linked chain that ensures the integrity and chronological order of the entire blockchain.
