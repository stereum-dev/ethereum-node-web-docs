# Smart Contract

**Definition:** A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. It automatically enforces and executes the terms of a contract based on predefined rules and conditions on the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating, verifying, or enforcing the negotiation or performance of a contract digitally.

**Category:** Blockchain Network

**Example:** A smart contract can be used to create a decentralized application (dApp) that automatically executes transactions when certain conditions are met, without the need for a central authority or intermediary.
