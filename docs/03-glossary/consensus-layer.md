# Consensus Layer

**Definition:** The Consensus Layer is the component of a blockchain responsible for achieving consensus on the state of the network. It operates using a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, where validators stake to propose and attest to blocks. This layer is crucial for the network's security, coordinating validators and ensuring the integrity and finality of transactions.

**Category:** Blockchain Network

**Example:** Validators in the Consensus Layer participate in processes like block proposals, attestations, and sync committees, contributing to the overall consensus on the blockchain's current state.
