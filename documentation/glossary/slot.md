### Slot

**Definition:** A slot is a time interval in a blockchain network during which a validator has the opportunity to propose a block. In Ethereum, a slot is the fundamental time unit, lasting approximately 12 seconds, and each epoch is composed of 32 slots. In Gnosis it last only 5 seconds, each epoch being composed of 16 slots. Not every slot will necessarily see a new block proposal, depending on the network conditions and validator participation.

**Category:** Blockchain Fundamentals

**Example:** In the operation of the Ethereum beacon chain, each slot represents a chance for a validator to propose a new block. If a validator is chosen to propose a block during a specific slot and successfully does so, their block is added to the chain, and they receive a block proposal reward.
