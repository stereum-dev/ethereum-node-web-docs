### Ethereum Node
**Definition:** An Ethereum node is a computer equipped with the necessary software to participate actively in the Ethereum network. It handles transaction and block validation but does not inherently engage in financial operations such as staking, which is reserved for specific types of nodes like staking nodes. Running your own node offers direct access to the Ethereum network, enabling the use of services built atop Ethereum that require an Ethereum Client RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoint for direct communication between applications.

**Example:** Using software like Stereum, a server can become an Ethereum node, connecting to and supporting the Ethereum network by processing transactions and blocks, and providing a gateway to interact with the blockchain through its RPC interface.
